#CSSCV
 
This CV is built using [CSSCV](https://github.com/csswizardry/csscv), a project by [CSS Wizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry). 

If you wish to make your own CSSCV, be sure to fork (Harry's project)[https://github.com/csswizardry/csscv] and not this one. I've stripped out a lot of elements that I don't need.
